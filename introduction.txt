Added introduction file
My name is Nkurunziza George, and I am passionate about data analytics and technology. I enjoy working on projects that involve data exploration, SQL, and automation using scripting languages like Bash. I'm also currently learning how systems work under the hood, especially in DevOps environments.

I'm always eager to improve my technical skills and contribute to real-world projects. Beyond technology, I value collaboration, problem-solving, and continuous learning." > introduction.txt
